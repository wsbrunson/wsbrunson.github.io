Just working out how this all works. Trying to design a cool template for my site and work out how posts and markup works.

{% highlight javascript %}
var print = function () {
    console.log('Hi, Tom');
};
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to the console.
{% endhighlight %}

Also trying out the code highlighting.

Signing off.
