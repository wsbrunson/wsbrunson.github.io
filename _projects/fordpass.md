## Overview
FordPass is a mobile application that connects drivers to services for their vehicles. Drivers can access the health of their vehicles, send commands to their vehicles, find parking, and schedule services at a participating dealership. Drivers can pay for services using FordPay in the application. If they ever need help, there are always Ford Guides ready to answer any questions.

This project was created as a joint partnership between Ford Motor Company and Pivotal Labs. I worked as a developer for Ford on an extended assignment with Pivotal Labs in Toronto, Ontario. I took part in a three-month developer enablement program during which my Ford teammates and I were taught software craftsmanship and Agile best practices from the Pivotal Labs team.
